Exercise4 :- Report Generation

        We are trying to simulate the data generated by a web application which asks user to enter the following

        Email address (assume yahoo.com, gmail.com, hotmail.com, rediffmail.com)
        City (assume Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkatta)
        And phone number (10 digit number)
        Write a script to create a subscribers.txt file which has fields: Email address, City, Phone number. 
        For each row - Randomly generate email ids with domains from the list mentioned above. Randomly select a city from the list above.  
        Randomly generate a 10 digit phone number.

        Subscribers.txt should have atleast 100 data rows.

        Now do the following

        a) Write a script to select users in subscribers.txt having yahoo.com email address and copy those rows to a new file.

        b) Write a script to select users in subscribers.txt who are from Chennai and copy those rows to a new file.
